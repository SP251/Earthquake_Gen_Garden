Project Name & Pitch

Earthquake Gen Garden

This is a simple app that shows a homepage with a list of earthquakes. It has a header with a logo (link back to home), and a link to a profile detail view. Each entry in the table links to a detail view of that particular record.

Features

•	Component

•	Router, Router parameters 
•	Default Export
•	const 
•	Used flex in the CSS 
•	Used CSS box model
•	Also tried with some pseudo classes in CSS
•	Want to fetch but data is not available in js with constant. Don't want to modify data.js.
•	Want to use the redux for state management.
•	Want to use the React component life cycle events like componentDidMount.

I chose to use the create-react-app boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving into weird technological rabbit holes.
